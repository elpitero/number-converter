'NumberConverter' is an actor that listens to requests in form of case class:
	-'Msg(msg: String)'  - when Msg is recevied 'NumberConverter' tries to execute conversion
	-'Stop' - when stopp is recieved 'ActorSystem' is terminated

 As a reponse it sends case class:
	- 'Res(response: String)' if conversion was sussesful
	-'Error(error: String)' if conversion was unsuccesful or neither 'Msg' nor 'Stop' case class was sent as request
	-'Stop' if msg == 'exit'

In this app 'User' actor is communicating with NumberConverter. After receving 'Start' request it starts listening for user input. It prints all received messages in terminal.
